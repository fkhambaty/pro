  "Okavo exists because the same thing keeps happening. Someone who is excellent at running a bakery, a clinic or a logistics firm decides they need software. They describe what they want. Money changes hands. Months later they receive something that is technically what they asked for and practically not what they meant.",
  "Nobody in that story is a villain. The developer built what they understood. The buyer described what they pictured. The gap between those two things is where the money goes.",
  "So Okavo is built around one stubborn rule: the expectation becomes a document, signed by both people, before a line of code is written. Everything else in the product exists to protect that rule.",

          <h1>Software goes wrong in the gap between what was meant and what was heard</h1>
          <p>
            Okavo exists to close that gap before it costs anyone money. Not
            with better project management — with a signed agreement that
            everything else has to obey.

              <p>
                Okavo launched in 2026. We are early and deliberately small: a
                hand-verified group of developers rather than an open flood of
                applicants.
              </p>
              <p>
                That means we cannot show you a decade of case studies. It also
                means every developer on the platform has been checked by a
                person, and that when you email support you reach someone who
                can actually change things.
